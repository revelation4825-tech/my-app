            The <strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong> is a translation of the Bible in contemporary English,
            working as a revision of the
            King James Version. Published by <em>Thomas Nelson</em>, the complete NKJV was released in 1982. The NKJV is
            described by Thomas Nelson as being "scrupulously faithful to the original [King James Version], yet truly
            updated to enhance its clarity and readability."
